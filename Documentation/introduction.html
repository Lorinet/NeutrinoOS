            <p class="title">Introduction to Neutrino</p>
            <p class="heading">What is Neutrino</p>
            Neutrino is an application development platform and operating system built for embedded devices, personal computers, IoT appliances, smart wearable devices and more.<br>
            The core of the system is based on a virtual machine (VM) which executes Neutrino bytecode.<br>
            The Neutrino bytecode is the compact encoding of the Neutrino instruction set architecture.<br>
            Bytecode can be created using the Intermediate Language Assembler (ntrasm) tool, which assembles programs written in Neutrino IL.<br>
            The Neutrino Runtime VM is available for Windows and for Linux, and allows Neutrino apps to be run concurrently with native apps.<br>
            The standalone Neutrino Core OS is composed of the Neutrino VM running on top of a minimal Linux kernel, and is designed for embedded systems and special-purpose computers.<br>
            <p class="heading">Features</p>
            The platform supports various powerful features, such as dynamic linking, system calls and dynamic memory management.<br>
            Dynamic memory management allows the developer to allocate variables with dynamic sizes, without dealing with pointers or memory locations, because the memory allocation is managed by the VM.<br>
            This also makes the platform secure to memory leaks and ensures that any code would manage memory optimally.<br>
            The user code communicates with the system (Neutrino VM) through system calls. The system calls perform a variety of low level OS functions (e.g. for I/O management, file system accesss etc.).<br>
